    "\n",
    "Building on our sample application in this tutorial, FUNWAVE-TVD, we will introduce some pragmatically-oriented best practices to help us improve our existing software quality and build towards a fully reproducible digital research and developement process. We will draw heavily from community-drivene recommndations published by organizations such as [The Software Carpentry Foundation](https://software-carpentry.org/), Github, Singularity, RedHat, The Open Science Foundation, The Open Container Initiative, and the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group. In doing so, we build upon community defined specifications and open source technologies such as [The Scientific File System](https://sci-f.github.io/spec)  an   open community efforts to  while focusing on how to realize them within the context of a tangible use case with technology readily availble to the open science community. In their white paper, \"[Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/),\" They succinctly lay out recommenations for a .\n",
