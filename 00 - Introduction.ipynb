    "Science Gateways provide web-based methods of accessing collection of applications, data services, and tools that enable domain scientists who are not familiar with computers to make use of computational science. Agave provides a collection of these data services and tools in a form that can easily wrap around existing, traditional applications and HPC systems and transform them into a usable gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, over the last four years, the popularity of container technologies such as Docker, Singularity, and Shifter resulted in their adoption within traditional HPC data centers. While not yet the dominant workload within many of the major centers, the portability of containerized applications has led to an explosion in the availability of bespoke and custom built codes alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "This containerized approach to computational science has enabled contributions by hundreds of new developers by bringing scalable, heterogeneous HPC to the web. It has empowered existing command line users by allowing them to commoditize their existing codes and pipelines as reproducible building blocks, and it has lowered the barrier to HPC for thousands more end users by giving them flexibility in how they interact with science and computation. This tutorial introduces these concepts to a new audience."
